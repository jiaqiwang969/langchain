It's a tough question to answer, and there are strong arguments for each of these quarterbacks. Here are some of the reasons why each of these quarterbacks could be considered the best:\n    \n    Tom Brady:\n    \n    * He has the most Super Bowl wins (6) of any quarterback in NFL history.\n    * He has been named Super Bowl MVP four times, more than any other player.\n    * He has led the New England Patriots to 18 playoff victories, the most in NFL history.\n    * He has thrown for over 70,000 yards in his career, the most of any quarterback in NFL history.\n    * He has thrown for 50 or more touchdowns in a season four times, the most of any quarterback in NFL history.\n    \n    Aaron Rodgers:\n    \n    * He has led the Green Bay Packers to a Super Bowl victory in 2010.\n    * He has been named Super Bowl MVP once.\n    * He has thrown for over 40,000 yards in his career, the most of any quarterback in NFL history.\n    * He has thrown for 40 or more touchdowns in a season three times, the most of any quarterback in NFL history.\n    * He has a career passer rating of 103.1, the highest of any quarterback in NFL history.\n    \n    So, who's the best quarterback in the NFL? It's a tough call, but here's my opinion:\n    \n    I think Aaron Rodgers is the best quarterback in the NFL right now. He has led the Packers to a Super Bowl victory and has had some incredible seasons, including the 2011 season when he threw for 45 touchdowns and just 6 interceptions. He has a strong arm, great accuracy, and is incredibly mobile for a quarterback of his size. He also has a great sense of timing and knows when to take risks and when to play it safe.\n    \n    Tom Brady is a close second, though. He has an incredible track record of success, including six Super Bowl victories, and has been one of the most consistent quarterbacks in the league for the past two decades.
