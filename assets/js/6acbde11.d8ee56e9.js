In lectures at the Newton Institute in June of 1993, Andrew Wiles announced a proof of a large part of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture and, as a consequence, Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. This report for nonexperts dis- cusses the mathematics involved in Wiles\u2019 lectures, including the necessary background and the mathematical history.\\n\\n1\\n\\n] T N . h t a m\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nOn June 23, 1993, Andrew Wiles wrote on a blackboard, before an audience at the Newton Institute in Cambridge, England, that if p is a prime number, u, v, and w are rational numbers, and up + vp + wp = 0, then uvw = 0. In other words, he announced that he could prove Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. His announce- ment came at the end of his series of three talks entitled \u201cModular forms, elliptic curves, and Galois representations\u201d at the week-long workshop on \u201cp-adic Galois representations, Iwasawa theory, and the Tamagawa numbers of motives\u201d.\\n\\n[\\n\\n1 v 0 2 2 7 0 4 9 / h t a m : v i X r a\\n\\nIn the margin of his copy of the works of Diophantus, next to a problem on\\n\\nPythagorean triples, Pierre de Fermat (1601\u20131665) wrote:\\n\\nCubum autem in duos cubos, aut quadratoquadratum in duos quadrato- quadratos, et generaliter nullam in in\ufb01nitum ultra quadratum potestatem in duos ejusdem nominis fas est dividere : cujus rei demonstrationem mirabilem sane detexi.

In this paper we will explain Wiles\u2019 work on elliptic curves and its connection with 1 we introduce elliptic curves and modularity, and Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. give the connection between Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem and the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture on the modularity of elliptic curves. In 2 we describe how Wiles re- duces the proof of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture to what we call the Modular Lifting Conjecture (which can be viewed as a weak form of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture), by using a theorem of Langlands and Tunnell. In 4 we show \xa7 how the Semistable Modular Lifting Conjecture is related to a conjecture of Mazur on deformations of Galois representations (Conjecture 4.2), and in 5 we describe Wiles\u2019 method of attack on this conjecture. In order to make this survey as acces- sible as possible to nonspecialists, the more technical details are postponed as long as possible, some of them to the appendices.\\n\\nIn\\n\\n\xa7\\n\\n\xa7\\n\\n3 and \xa7\\n\\n\xa7\\n\\nMuch of this report is based on Wiles\u2019 lectures in Cambridge. The authors apol- ogize for any errors we may have introduced. We also apologize to those whose mathematical contributions we, due to our incomplete understanding, do not prop- erly acknowledge.\\n\\nThe ideas Wiles introduced in his Cambridge lectures will have an important in\ufb02uence on research in number theory. Because of the great interest in this subject and the lack of a publicly available manuscript, we hope this report will be useful to the mathematics community. In early December 1993, shortly before this paper went to press, Wiles announced that \u201cthe \ufb01nal calculation of a precise upper bound for the Selmer group in the semistable case\u201d (see 5.4 below) \u201cis not yet \xa7 complete as it stands,\u201d but that he believes he will be able to \ufb01nish it in the near future using the ideas explained in his Cambridge lectures. While Wiles\u2019 proof of Theorem 5.3 below and Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem depends on the calculation he referred to in his December announcement, Theorem 5.4 and Corollary 5.5 do not. Wiles\u2019 work provides for the \ufb01rst time in\ufb01nitely many modular elliptic curves over the rational numbers which are not isomorphic over the complex numbers (see 5.5 for an explicit in\ufb01nite family).\\n\\n5.3 and\\n\\n\xa7\\n\\n\xa7\\n\\nNotation. The integers, rational numbers, complex numbers, and p-adic integers will be denoted Z, Q, C, and Zp, respectively. If F is a \ufb01eld, then \xafF denotes an algebraic closure of F .\\n\\n1. Connection between Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem and elliptic curves\\n\\n1.1. Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem follows from modularity of elliptic curves. Suppose Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem were false. Then there would exist nonzero integers a, b, c, and n > 2 such that an + bn = cn. It is easy to see that no generality is lost by assuming that n is a prime greater than three (or greater than four million, by [2]; see [14] for n = 3 and 4) and that a and b are relatively prime. Write down the cubic curve:\\n\\ny2 = x(x + an)(x\\n\\nbn).\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n\u2212\\n\\nA REPORT ON WILES\u2019 CAMBRIDGE LECTURES\\n\\n3\\n\\n1.4 we will explain what it means for an elliptic curve to be modular. Kenneth Ribet [27] proved that if n is a prime greater than three, a, b, and c are nonzero integers, and an + bn = cn, then the elliptic curve (1) is not modular. But the results announced by Wiles imply the following.\\n\\nIn\\n\\n1.3 we will see that such curves are elliptic curves, and in\\n\\n\xa7\\n\\n\xa7\\n\\nTheorem 1.1 (Wiles).

The story of the connection between Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem and elliptic curves begins in 1955, when Yutaka Taniyama (1927\u20131958) posed problems which may be viewed as a weaker version of the following conjecture (see [38]).\\n\\nTaniyama-Shimura Conjecture. Every elliptic curve over Q is modular.\\n\\nThe conjecture in the present form was made by Goro Shimura around 1962\u201364 and has become better understood due to work of Shimura [33\u201337] and of Andr\xb4e Weil [42] (see also [7]). The Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture is one of the major conjectures in number theory.\\n\\nBeginning in the late 1960s [15\u201318], Yves Hellegouarch connected Fermat equa- tions an + bn = cn with elliptic curves of the form (1) and used results about Fer- mat\u2019s Last Theorem to prove results about elliptic curves. The landscape changed abruptly in 1985 when Gerhard Frey stated in a lecture at Oberwolfach that elliptic curves arising from counterexamples to Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem could not be mod- ular [11]. Shortly thereafter Ribet [27] proved this, following ideas of Jean-Pierre Serre [32] (see [24] for a survey). In other words, \u201cTaniyama-Shimura Conjecture\\n\\nFermat\u2019s Last Theorem\u201d. Thus, the stage was set. A proof of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture (or enough of it to know that elliptic curves coming from Fermat equations are modular) would be a proof of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem.\\n\\n\u21d2\\n\\n1.3. Elliptic curves.\\n\\nDe\ufb01nition. An elliptic curve over Q is a nonsingular curve de\ufb01ned by an equation of the form\\n\\ny2 + a1xy + a3y = x3 + a2x2 + a4x + a6\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nwhere the coe\ufb03cients ai are integers.

(i) A singular point on a curve f (x, y) = 0 is a point where both partial derivatives vanish. A curve is nonsingular if it has no singular points.\\n\\n(ii) Two elliptic curves over Q are isomorphic if one can be obtained from the other by changing coordinates x = A2x\u2032 + B, y = A3y\u2032 + Cx\u2032 + D, with A, B, C, D\\n\\nQ and dividing through by A6.\\n\\n\u2208 (iii) Every elliptic curve over Q is isomorphic to one of the form\\n\\ny2 = x3 + a2x2 + a4x + a6\\n\\nwith integers ai. A curve of this form is nonsingular if and only if the cubic on the right side has no repeated roots.\\n\\nExample. The equation y2 = x(x + 32)(x\\n\\n42) de\ufb01nes an elliptic curve over Q.\\n\\n\u2212\\n\\n1.4. Modularity.

It can be com- pleted to a compact Riemann surface, denoted X0(N ), by adjoining a \ufb01nite set of points called cusps. The cusps are the \ufb01nitely many equivalence classes of Q \u221e} under the action of \u03930(N ) (see Chapter 1 of [35]).

There are many equivalent de\ufb01nitions of modularity (see II.4.D of [24] and appendix of [22]). In some cases the equivalence is a deep result.

An elliptic curve over Q is semistable at the prime q if it is isomorphic to an elliptic curve over Q which modulo q either is nonsingular or has a singu- lar point with two distinct tangent directions. An elliptic curve over Q is called semistable if it is semistable at every prime.\\n\\nExample. The elliptic curve y2 = x(x + 32)(x isomorphic to y2 + xy + y = x3 + x2 x(x + 42)(x\\n\\n42) is semistable because it is \u2212 10, but the elliptic curve y2 =\\n\\n10x\\n\\n\u2212\\n\\n\u2212\\n\\n32) is not semistable (it is not semistable at 2).\\n\\n\u2212\\n\\n2 we explain how Wiles shows that his main result on Galois representations (Theorem 5.3) implies the following part of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture.\\n\\nBeginning in\\n\\n\xa7\\n\\nSemistable Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture. Every semistable elliptic curve over Q is modular.\\n\\nA REPORT ON WILES\u2019 CAMBRIDGE LECTURES\\n\\n5\\n\\nProposition 1.2. The Semistable Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture implies Theorem 1.1.\\n\\nProof. If A and B are distinct, nonzero, relatively prime integers, write EA,B for the elliptic curve de\ufb01ned by y2 = x(x + A)(x + B). Since EA,B and E\u2212A,\u2212B are isomorphic over the complex numbers (i.e., as Riemann surfaces), EA,B is modular if and only if E\u2212A,\u2212B is modular. If further AB(A B) is divisible by 16, then either EA,B or E\u2212A,\u2212B is semistable (this is easy to check directly; see for example I.1 of [24]). The Semistable Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture now implies that both \xa7 EA,B and E\u2212A,\u2212B are modular, and thus implies Theorem 1.1.\\n\\n\u2212\\n\\nRemark . In 1.1 we saw that Theorem 1.1 and Ribet\u2019s Theorem together imply Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem.

In this paper we will work with a de\ufb01nition of modularity which uses modular forms.\\n\\nDe\ufb01nition.

The task now is to construct an Euler system of cohomology classes with which to bound #(SD(Vn)) using Kolyvagin\u2019s method. This is the most technically di\ufb03cult part of Wiles\u2019 proof and is the part of Wiles\u2019 work he referred to as not yet complete in his December announcement. We give only general remarks about Wiles\u2019 construction.\\n\\nThe \ufb01rst step in the construction is due to Flach [10]. He constructed classes consisting of just one prime.

Earlier examples of Euler systems come from cyclotomic or elliptic units, Gauss sums, or Heegner points on elliptic curves. Wiles (following Flach) constructs his cohomology classes from modular units, i.e., meromorphic functions on modular curves which are holo- morphic and nonzero away from the cusps. More precisely, \u03ba( ) comes from an explicit function on the modular curve X1(L, N ), the curve obtained by taking the quotient space of the upper half plane by the action of the group\\n\\nL\\n\\na b c d\\n\\nSL2(Z) : c\\n\\n1 (mod L) } \u2261 \u2113\u2208L \u2113 and where N is the N of (T2) of\\n\\n0\\n\\n(mod LN ),\\n\\na\\n\\nd\\n\\n,\\n\\n\u03931(L, N ) =\\n\\n\u2208\\n\\n\u2261\\n\\n\u2261\\n\\n{ (cid:1) (cid:0) and adjoining the cusps, where L = The construction and study of the classes \u03ba( [8], [9] and others.\\n\\n4.2. ) rely heavily on results of Faltings\\n\\n\xa7\\n\\nL\\n\\nQ\\n\\n5.5. Wiles\u2019 results. Wiles announced two main results (Theorems 5.3 and 5.4 below) in the direction of Mazur\u2019s conjecture, under two di\ufb00erent sets of hypotheses on the representation \xaf\u03c1. Theorem 5.3 implies the Semistable Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture and Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. Wiles\u2019 proof of Theorem 5.3 depends on the not-yet-complete construction of an appropriate Euler system (as in 5.4), while his proof of Theorem 5.4 (though not yet fully checked) does not. For Theorem 5.4, Wiles bounds the Selmer group of 5.2 without constructing a new Euler system, by using results from the Iwasawa theory of imaginary quadratic \ufb01elds. (These results in turn rely on Kolyvagin\u2019s method and the Euler system of elliptic units; see [31].)\\n\\n\xa7\\n\\n\xa7\\n\\nSince for ease of exposition we de\ufb01ned modularity of representations in terms of \u03930(N ) instead of \u03931(N ), the theorems stated below are weaker than those an- nounced by Wiles, but have the same applications to elliptic curves.

Therefore there are in\ufb01nitely many elliptic curves E\u2032 over Q which are semistable at 5 and satisfy\\n\\n\u2208\\n\\n\u2208\\n\\n6\\n\\n\u2208\\n\\n(i) E\u2032[5] \u223c= E[5] as GQ-modules, and (ii) E\u2032[3] has no subgroup of order 3 stable under GQ.\\n\\nIt follows from (i) and the semistability of E that E\u2032 is semistable at all primes = 5, and thus E\u2032 is semistable. We therefore have in\ufb01nitely many semistable q elliptic curves E\u2032 which satisfy the desired conditions.\\n\\n6\\n\\nAppendix C.
