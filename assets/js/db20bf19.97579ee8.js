And finally, clue #4 gives us his last name: Armstrong.\n    Therefore, the first man on the moon was Neil Armstrong!\n\n    \n    llama_print_timings:        load time =  9623.21 ms\n    llama_print_timings:      sample time =   143.77 ms /   203 runs   (    0.71 ms per token,  1412.01 tokens per second)\n    llama_print_timings: prompt eval time =   485.94 ms /     7 tokens (   69.42 ms per token,    14.40 tokens per second)\n    llama_print_timings:        eval time =  6385.16 ms /   202 runs   (   31.61 ms per token,    31.64 tokens per second)\n    llama_print_timings:       total time =  7279.28 ms\n\n\n\n\n\n    \" and use logical reasoning to figure out who the first man on the moon was.\\n\\nHere are some clues:\\n\\n1.
