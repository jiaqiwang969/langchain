Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up  \n    and the middle out, not from the top down.  \n    \n    Because we know that when the middle class grows, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well. \n    \n    America used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth. \n    \n    Now our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world.\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Document 7:\n    \n    And tonight, I\u2019m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud. \n    \n    By the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.  \n    \n    The only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. \n    \n    Lowering your costs also means demanding more competition. \n    \n    I\u2019m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isn\u2019t capitalism. \n    \n    It\u2019s exploitation\u2014and it drives up prices.\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Document 8:\n    \n    For the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else. \n    \n    But that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century. \n    \n    Vice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America.\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Document 9:\n    \n    All told, we created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year. \n    \n    Powered by people I\u2019ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who\u2019s here with us tonight. \n    \n    As Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, \u201cIt\u2019s time to bury the label \u201cRust Belt.\u201d \n    \n    It\u2019s time. \n    \n    But with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills.\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Document 10:\n    \n    I\u2019m also calling on Congress: pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and comprehensive health care they deserve. \n    \n    And fourth, let\u2019s end cancer as we know it. \n    \n    This is personal to me and Jill, to Kamala, and to so many of you. \n    \n    Cancer is the #2 cause of death in America\u2013second only to heart disease.\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Document 11:\n    \n    He will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world. \n    \n    We meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced. \n    \n    The pandemic has been punishing. \n    \n    And so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more. \n    \n    I understand.\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Document 12:\n    \n    Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n    \n    Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n    \n    Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n    \n    With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n    \n    And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny.\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Document 13:\n    \n    I know. \n    \n    One of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden. \n    \n    We don\u2019t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops. \n    \n    But I\u2019m committed to finding out everything we can. \n    \n    Committed to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio. \n    \n    The widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.  \n    \n    He was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq.\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Document 14:\n    \n    And soon, we\u2019ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. \n    \n    So tonight I\u2019m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.  \n    \n    First, beat the opioid epidemic. \n    \n    There is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Document 15:\n    \n    Third, support our veterans. \n    \n    Veterans are the best of us. \n    \n    I\u2019ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home. \n    \n    My administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.  \n    \n    Our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers.\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Document 16:\n    \n    When we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven\u2019t done in a long time: build a better America. \n    \n    For more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation. \n    \n    And I know you\u2019re tired, frustrated, and exhausted. \n    \n    But I also know this.\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Document 17:\n    \n    Now is the hour. \n    \n    Our moment of responsibility. \n    \n    Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n    \n    It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n    \n    Well I know this nation.  \n    \n    We will meet the test. \n    \n    To protect freedom and liberty, to expand fairness and opportunity. \n    \n    We will save democracy. \n    \n    As hard as these times have been, I am more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life.\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Document 18:\n    \n    He didn\u2019t know how to stop fighting, and neither did she. \n    \n    Through her pain she found purpose to demand we do better. \n    \n    Tonight, Danielle\u2014we are. \n    \n    The VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to diseases, already helping more veterans get benefits. \n    \n    And tonight, I\u2019m announcing we\u2019re expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers.\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Document 19:\n    \n    I understand. \n    \n    I remember when my Dad had to leave our home in Scranton, Pennsylvania to find work. I grew up in a family where if the price of food went up, you felt it. \n    \n    That\u2019s why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan.  \n    \n    Because people were hurting. We needed to act, and we did. \n    \n    Few pieces of legislation have done more in a critical moment in our history to lift us out of crisis.\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Document 20:\n    \n    So let\u2019s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. \n    \n    Let\u2019s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. \n    \n    That\u2019s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers.\n"))),(0,o.kt)("h2",{id:"doing-reranking-with-coherererank"},"Doing reranking with CohereRerank"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Now let's wrap our base retriever with a ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"ContextualCompressionRetriever"),".
