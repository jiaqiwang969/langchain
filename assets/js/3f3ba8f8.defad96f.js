However, their success heavily relies on human input to guide the conversation, which can be challenging and time-consuming. This paper explores the potential of building scalable techniques to facilitate autonomous cooperation among communicative agents and provide insight into their "cognitive" processes. To address the challenges of achieving autonomous cooperation, we propose a novel communicative agent framework named role-playing. Our approach involves using inception prompting to guide chat agents toward task completion while maintaining consistency with human intentions. We showcase how role-playing can be used to generate conversational data for studying the behaviors and capabilities of chat agents, providing a valuable resource for investigating conversational language models. Our contributions include introducing a novel communicative agent framework, offering a scalable approach for studying the cooperative behaviors and capabilities of multi-agent systems, and open-sourcing our library to support research on communicative agents and beyond.'),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"The original implementation: ",(0,s.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://github.com/lightaime/camel"},"https://github.com/lightaime/camel")),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"Project website: ",(0,s.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.camel-ai.org/"},"https://www.camel-ai.org/")),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"Arxiv paper: ",(0,s.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17760"},"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17760")),(0,s.kt)("h2",{id:"import-langchain-related-modules"},"Import LangChain related modules"),(0,s.kt)("pre",null,(0,s.kt)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-python"},'\x3c!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "ChatOpenAI", "source": "langchain.chat_models", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chat_models/langchain.chat_models.openai.ChatOpenAI.html", "title": "CAMEL Role-Playing Autonomous Cooperative Agents"}, {"imported": "SystemMessagePromptTemplate", "source": "langchain.prompts.chat", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/prompts/langchain.prompts.chat.SystemMessagePromptTemplate.html", "title": "CAMEL Role-Playing Autonomous Cooperative Agents"}, {"imported": "HumanMessagePromptTemplate", "source": "langchain.prompts.chat", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/prompts/langchain.prompts.chat.HumanMessagePromptTemplate.html", "title": "CAMEL Role-Playing Autonomous Cooperative Agents"}, {"imported": "AIMessage", "source": "langchain.schema", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/schema/langchain.schema.messages.AIMessage.html", "title": "CAMEL Role-Playing Autonomous Cooperative Agents"}, {"imported": "HumanMessage", "source": "langchain.schema", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/schema/langchain.schema.messages.HumanMessage.html", "title": "CAMEL Role-Playing Autonomous Cooperative Agents"}, {"imported": "SystemMessage", "source": "langchain.schema", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/schema/langchain.schema.messages.SystemMessage.html", "title": "CAMEL Role-Playing Autonomous Cooperative Agents"}, {"imported": "BaseMessage", "source": "langchain.schema", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/schema/langchain.schema.messages.BaseMessage.html", "title": "CAMEL Role-Playing Autonomous Cooperative Agents"}]--\x3e\nfrom typing import List\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain.prompts.chat import (\n    SystemMessagePromptTemplate,\n    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,\n)\nfrom langchain.schema import (\n    AIMessage,\n    HumanMessage,\n    SystemMessage,\n    BaseMessage,\n)\n')),(0,s.kt)("h2",{id:"define-a-camel-agent-helper-class"},"Define a CAMEL agent helper class"),(0,s.kt)("pre",null,(0,s.kt)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-python"},"class CAMELAgent:\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        system_message: SystemMessage,\n        model: ChatOpenAI,\n    ) -> None:\n        self.system_message = system_message\n        self.model = model\n        self.init_messages()\n\n    def reset(self) -> None:\n        self.init_messages()\n        return self.stored_messages\n\n    def init_messages(self) -> None:\n        self.stored_messages = [self.system_message]\n\n    def update_messages(self, message: BaseMessage) -> List[BaseMessage]:\n        self.stored_messages.append(message)\n        return self.stored_messages\n\n    def step(\n        self,\n        input_message: HumanMessage,\n    ) -> AIMessage:\n        messages = self.update_messages(input_message)\n\n        output_message = self.model(messages)\n        self.update_messages(output_message)\n\n        return output_message\n")),(0,s.kt)("h2",{id:"setup-openai-api-key-and-roles-and-task-for-role-playing"},"Setup OpenAI API key and roles and task for role-playing"),(0,s.kt)("pre",null,(0,s.kt)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-python"},'import os\n\nos.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""\n\nassistant_role_name = "Python Programmer"\nuser_role_name = "Stock Trader"\ntask = "Develop a trading bot for the stock market"\nword_limit = 50  # word limit for task brainstorming\n')),(0,s.kt)("h2",{id:"create-a-task-specify-agent-for-brainstorming-and-get-the-specified-task"},"Create a task specify agent for brainstorming and get the specified task"),(0,s.kt)("pre",null,(0,s.kt)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-python"},'task_specifier_sys_msg = SystemMessage(content="You can make a task more specific.")\ntask_specifier_prompt = """Here is a task that {assistant_role_name} will help {user_role_name} to complete: {task}.\nPlease make it more specific.

We can use the following code to create the new column:\n    \n    ```\n    stop_loss = stop_loss_percent / 100\n    profit_target = profit_target_percent / 100\n    \n    new_df['pnl'] = 0.0\n    buy_price = 0.0\n    for i in range(1, len(new_df)):\n        if new_df['signal'][i] == 1 and new_df['signal'][i-1] == -1:\n            buy_price = new_df['close'][i]\n        elif new_df['signal'][i] == -1 and new_df['signal'][i-1] == 1:\n            sell_price = new_df['close'][i]\n            if sell_price <= buy_price * (1 - stop_loss):\n                new_df['pnl'][i] = -stop_loss\n            elif sell_price >= buy_price * (1 + profit_target):\n                new_df['pnl'][i] = profit_target\n            else:\n                new_df['pnl'][i] = (sell_price - buy_price) / buy_price\n    ```\n    \n    This will create a new column called 'pnl' in the DataFrame that indicates the profit or loss for each trade based on the buy and sell signals and the defined stop loss and profit target. The stop loss and profit target are calculated based on the stop_loss_percent and profit_target_percent variables, respectively. The buy and sell prices are stored in the buy_price and sell_price variables, respectively. If the sell price is less than or equal to the stop loss, the profit or loss is set to -stop_loss. If the sell price is greater than or equal to the profit target, the profit or loss is set to profit_target. Otherwise, the profit or loss is calculated as (sell_price - buy_price) / buy_price.

We can use the following code to visualize the data:\n    \n    ```\n    plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))\n    plt.plot(new_df.index, new_df['close'], label='Close')\n    plt.plot(new_df.index, new_df['short_ma'], label='Short MA')\n    plt.plot(new_df.index, new_df['long_ma'], label='Long MA')\n    plt.xlabel('Date')\n    plt.ylabel('Price')\n    plt.title('Stock Data with Moving Averages')\n    plt.legend()\n    plt.show()\n    ```\n    \n    This will create a line chart that visualizes the stock data, short-term moving average, and long-term moving average. The x-axis represents the date and the y-axis represents the price. The chart also includes a legend that labels each line.

We can use the following code to visualize the signals:\n    \n    ```\n    buy_signals = new_df[new_df['signal'] == 1]\n    sell_signals = new_df[new_df['signal'] == -1]\n    \n    plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))\n    plt.scatter(buy_signals.index, buy_signals['close'], label='Buy', marker='^', color='green')\n    plt.scatter(sell_signals.index, sell_signals['close'], label='Sell', marker='v', color='red')\n    plt.plot(new_df.index, new_df['close'], label='Close')\n    plt.xlabel('Date')\n    plt.ylabel('Price')\n    plt.title('Buy and Sell Signals')\n    plt.legend()\n    plt.show()\n    ```\n    \n    This will create a scatter plot that visualizes the buy and sell signals. The x-axis represents the date and the y-axis represents the price. The chart also includes a legend that labels each point.
